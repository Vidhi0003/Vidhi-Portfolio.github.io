### Professional Experience - Currently looking for a Winter/Spring 2026 CO-OP
- Current Positions:
    - Head Teaching Assistant - Currently, I have been promoted to head teaching assistant. I am the point of contact for students and would help them with any issues regarding their grades. I lead several lab sections and create slides to aid with understanding. I also hold office hours where I help students with their code and help hem think through assignments.

    - Academic Tutor - I tutor for a multitude of different courses in CS as well as multiple coding languages. I tutor in C++, C, Python, R, Java, F#, Prolog, and SQL. So far, I have helped over 200 students!
        - The classes I tutor for:
            - Program Design I & II
            - Mathematical Foundations of Computing
            - Programming Practicum
            - Data Structures
            - Machine Organization
            - Software Design
            - Systems Programming
            - Computer Design
            - Economics and Computation
         
- Past Positions:
    - Data Structures Teaching Assistant - I was the teaching assitant over the summer of 2025 and I helped with creating exams, grading as well as proctoring. I held 8+ weekly office hours to aid students on assignments.

    - Program Design I TA - I TA'ed for an introductory Python class where I worked in several different areas such as project development as well as helping out with labs and grading.

    - Software Developer Intern - In 2023, I worked on a website for my university where I collected data as well as optimized code in C++. This was to help create a website where students coming into the university would have an easier time creating a plan for their degrees and understand what classes they would have to take in order to graduate within the time they have set.

- React

# Projects

- Battleship - I developed this single-player game along with a partner where we used JavaFX and client-server to allow the user to play against an AI. I ended up learning a lot while creating this project as I learned how to use Figma, Maven, and how to create the front-end and back-end of applications.
  
- Robotics Catch Game - My group and I worked on this game using Arduinos and mutiple different devices to create a real-time interactive game. Every single member worked on the devices and the code associated. We were able to successfully present our game and managed to achieve our goals for this project.

# Involvement

- WICS & WICyS Fellow - I am an active member of these clubs. I help with advising students on how to navigate their Computer Science degree as well as mentor people on topics they are confused about.
- Uncommon Hacks 2025: I learned how to use react and how to utilize many different softwares. I was able to work in a team where we did data analysis and incorporated that into our website created with React.
- Wild Hacks 2025: During this hackathon, my team wanted to create a website that would help people plan out their meal times based on their schedules. We used React, Flask and added Auth0 to make the authentication unique to the university so that people not from the university cannot make false reviews as we wanted students to be able to share their opinions on the restaurants across campus.
