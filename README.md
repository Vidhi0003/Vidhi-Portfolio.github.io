# Vidhi's Portfolio

### Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio!
My name is Vidhi and I am currently a senior attending University! I am studying Computer Science and I love learning new coding languages! Currently I am looking for an co-op for the winter/spring of 2026!

# Professional Experience - Currently looking for an CO-OP!
- Academic Tutor - I tutor for a multitude of different courses in CS as well as multiple coding languages. I tutor in C++, C, Python, R, Java, F#, Prolog, and SQL. So far, I have helped over 200 students!
    - The classes I tutor for:
        - Program Design I & II
        - Mathematical Foundations of Computing
        - Programming Practicum
        - Data Structures
        - Machine Organization
        - Software Design
        - Systems Programming

- Python TA - I TA for an introductory Python class where I work in several different areas such as project development as well as helping out with labs and grading.

- Software Developer Intern - In 2023, I worked on a website for my university where I collected data as well as optimized code in C++
  
# Coding languages I know
- Python
- C++
- C
- Java
- R
- Javascript
- Swift
- SQL
- React

# Projects

- Battleship - I developed this single-player game along with a partner where we used JavaFX and client-server to allow the user to play against an AI. I ended up learning a lot while creating this project as I learned how to use Figma, Maven, and how to create the front-end and back-end of applications.
  
- Robotics Catch Game - My group and I worked on this game using Arduinos and mutiple different devices to create a real-time interactive game. Every single member worked on the devices and the code associated. We were able to successfully present our game and managed to achieve our goals for this project.

# Involvement

- Uncommon Hacks 2025: I learned how to use react and how to utilize many different softwares. I was able to work in a team where we did data analysis and incorporated that into our website created with React.
- Wild Hacks 2025: During this hackathon, my team wanted to create a website that would help people plan out their meal times based on their schedules. We used React, Flask and added Auth0 to make the authentication unique to the university so that people not from the university cannot make false reviews as we wanted students to be able to share their opinions on the restaurants across campus.
