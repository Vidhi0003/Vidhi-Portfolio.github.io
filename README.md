### Projects

- Battleship - I developed this single-player game along with a partner where we used JavaFX and client-server to allow the user to play against an AI. I ended up learning a lot while creating this project as I learned how to use Figma, Maven, and how to create the front-end and back-end of applications.
- Robotics Catch Game - My group and I worked on this game using Arduinos and mutiple different devices to create a real-time interactive game. Every single member worked on the devices and the code associated. We were able to successfully present our game and managed to achieve our goals for this project.
